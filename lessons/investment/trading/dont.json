You may have a friend who claims to be a day-trader, looking at technical analysis and executing well-timed trades. You may have even given it a shot yourself.\n\nOur advice is simple: All of this is one of the biggest possible wastes of time and effort. And it comes down to one truth: buying equities and debt is a good deal. Selling them is a bad deal.\n\nMore often than not, the simple ownership of as many shares as you can afford is by far the best strategy, without any complicated rebalancing strategies, dollar-cost averaging, sector rotating, or trying to identify tops, bottoms, trends, or whatever a \"bull flag\" is. Many people with much more leverage and research attempt this on a daily basis, and nearly always fail. It's incredibly futile, but buying shares is not! Whether you buy shares for one day or ten years, you will generally earn about 9% per year when you own the shares, and -2% per year (to inflation) when you do not. By choosing to sell shares, jumping in and out of positions, you are doing quite a poor job of maximizing the time that you are exposed to the 9% growth.\n\nIn the next article, we will provide some additional reasons why we favor a buy-and-hold strategy."
